            The Chernobyl "Suicide Squad", or Chernobyl 3, was a group of three people, two engineers and a supervisor, who are widely regarded as heroes in the Chernobyl Nuclear Meltdown of 1986 in the USSR (now Ukraine). After the No. 4 reactor melted down and exploded, the radioactive fuel from the reactor leaked to the floors below. The slug of graphite, fuel, and other components was at a temperature of more than 1,200&#176;C. The floors below the slug were filled with water as part of the bubbler system, which was used for emergency cooling and steam condensing. If the slug came in contact with the water, it posed a huge explosion risk that could spread radioactive material over half of Europe.

            Three men, Alexei Ananenko, Valeri Bezpalov, and Boris Baranov volunteered to proceed to open a valve that would drain the bubbler floors and prevent the immenent disaster. In order to reach the valve it was required to wade through knee-deep radioactive water down a corridor. They managed to open the valve, which released the water through the sluice gates and averted further disaster. 32 years later, in 2018, the three men were awarded the Order for Courage by Ukranian President Petro Poroshenko.

            There are many myths around the event, foremost of which is the widely-recounted tale that the three men died from acute radiation poisoning days after the event. As it stands, two of the three men are still alive today and the third died in 2005.
